Layered abstractions cover the worker-side dispatch lifetime:

  queues bridging the gRPC main loop and the worker loop.
- :func:`_step` — inner routine stepper. One step per request,

    Async context manager and async iterator that owns the routine's
    worker-side lifetime end-to-end:

    - **Parse phase** (``__aenter__``) reads the first
      :class:`protocol.Request` off *request_iterator* and parses
      it: resolves the negotiated serializer (cloudpickle for
      cross-process dispatch, a per-task
      :class:`PassthroughSerializer` from :data:`_passthrough_pool`
      for self-dispatch), decodes the caller's wool.Context
      snapshot, rebuilds the wool.Task under
      ``attached(context, guarded=False)``, and validates the
      routine type. Failures are wrapped in :class:`Rejected`
      so the dispatch handler can surface them via
      Nack-with-exception. A first-request read failure (empty
      iterator, gRPC error) propagates raw — no parsed payload
      exists to serialize for the caller.

      The worker-loop driver is **not** scheduled here; that
      happens lazily on the first ``__aiter__`` call so the
      dispatch handler can run pre-iteration decisions
      (backpressure) against the parsed task and context without
      contending with the worker for ``Context._guard()``.

    - **Iteration** (``__aiter__``) schedules the worker driver on
      first call and drives the request/response loop on the main
      loop. Sets up cross-loop :class:`_RequestQueue` /
      :class:`_ResponseQueue` and submits a worker-loop task that
      enters :func:`_scoped` for the parsed task and drives the
      routine through :func:`_step`. The
      :class:`concurrent.futures.Future` held by the response
      queue surfaces pre-stream worker failures so they propagate
      out of :meth:`_ResponseQueue.get` rather than hang
      iteration. Forwards each subsequent
      :class:`protocol.Request` from *request_iterator* through
      the request queue and yields one :class:`_Response` per
      response. The coroutine path synthesizes a single ``"next"``
      request. Pre-stream worker failures raise out of
      :meth:`_ResponseQueue.get` and propagate raw — the dispatch
      handler's terminal-exception clause builds the wire response
      with a snapshot of ``self.context`` and the dumped exception.

    - **Teardown** (``__aexit__``) calls :meth:`drain` (close
      request queue + await ``worker_done``) before unwinding
      the exit stack. Worker exceptions surfaced via
      ``worker_done`` are silently swallowed — pre-stream and
      routine-time failures already shipped via the
      terminal-exception clause, so logging here would
      double-surface the same signal. Post-iteration teardown
      failures (``_scoped``'s cleanup raising after a clean run)
      currently fall into the same swallow; restoring an
      operator-visible log for that specific case is a
      follow-up.

    - **Cancellation** (``cancel``) sets a flag, cancels the
      worker driver task on the worker loop, and pushes ``_EOS``
      onto the response queue. The worker-task cancellation is
      what propagates :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` into a
      routine mid-``_step``; without it, a compute-bound or
      sleeping routine would run to natural completion after the
      caller has gone away. Used by the service's docket-cancel
      path on shutdown and by the dispatch handler as the on-exit
      cleanup hook. Idempotent.

    Public attributes ``.task``, ``.context``, ``.serializer`` are
    populated on enter for use by the dispatch handler (e.g.,
    backpressure).

    :param request_iterator:
        The bidirectional request stream. The first frame is read
        in ``__aenter__``; subsequent frames are forwarded by
        ``__aiter__`` for async-generator routines.

        the dispatch handler) that owns this dispatch's routine

        snapshot it for the terminal-exception response.

        Worker exceptions raised during the drain are swallowed

        failures already propagated out of ``__aiter__`` and

        injected ``CancelledError`` rather than one already set

        graceful-shutdown sequence destroys the worker loop before
        the dispatch handler's ``__aexit__`` (or terminal-exception
        clause) runs, ``call_soon_threadsafe`` raises

        Sets a flag observed by :meth:`_schedule_worker` (so a
        cancellation arriving before the first :meth:`__aiter__`
        short-circuits the worker schedule) and by :meth:`_iterate`
        (so iteration surfaces :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` at
        the next yield boundary — mirroring stdlib's ``await task``
        semantics where ``task.cancel()`` from any source produces
        the same observable), cancels the worker driver task on the
        worker loop so a routine mid-``_step`` (e.g.,
        ``await asyncio.sleep(...)``) receives a
        :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` rather than running to
        natural completion, and pushes ``_EOS`` onto the response
        queue so any suspended :meth:`_ResponseQueue.get` returns
        ``None`` and unblocks the iterator.

        Worker-task cancellation is scheduled via
        ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe`` to remain cross-loop safe,
        and tolerates a closed worker loop (the dispatch is no
        longer serviceable; the existing ``RuntimeError`` swallow
        on ``call_soon_threadsafe`` matches :meth:`drain`'s
        tolerance).

        Unlike a direct ``aclose()`` on :attr:`_iterator`, this is
        safe to call from a task other than the one driving the
        iterator — no ``RuntimeError("asynchronous generator is
        already running")`` is possible because no aclose is
        attempted.

        Suspension caveat. The three signals — ``_cancelled`` flag,
        worker-task cancel, ``_EOS`` push — together unblock
        :meth:`_iterate`'s ``_ResponseQueue.get`` suspensions and any
        inter-step ``_cancelled`` observation. They do NOT interrupt
        a request-iterator read in flight: a streaming dispatch
        idling on ``async for protobuf_request in
        self._request_iterator`` (between the dispatch handler's
        last yield and the caller's next ``asend``/``anext``) only
        observes ``_cancelled`` after a new frame arrives or after
        the gRPC layer tears the stream down. The operator-preempt
        path (:meth:`WorkerService._preempt`) relies on the broader
        gRPC server shutdown to cancel the stream and close that
        gap; ``cancel()`` alone does not match stdlib
        ``task.cancel()`` for that specific suspension.
